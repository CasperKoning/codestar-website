#Howto
npm install
npm run dev

#Deploying

To put the site live on http://codestar.nl make sure that the compiled website is pushed to https://github.com/OrdinaNederland/OrdinaNederland.github.io#master  .

#Development
We don't push to master, but let our 'highly intelligent' build script do that for us!
Our base branch is develop, from there we create feature branches.
We create pull requests from these feature branches.

For issues see: https://github.com/OrdinaNederland/codestar-website/issues
