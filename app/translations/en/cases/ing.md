# About ING

ING: the bank as an IT company with a banking license. ING wants to be the world leading innovator on financial technology 
and offers an atmosphere that is attractive to developers. More than 300 developers work on varying aspects of ING's online 
presence. To support this ING has embraced the agile Spotify model and DevOps, making each team responsible for the business 
and IT side of one or more applications.

Codestar is working on INGâ€™s online appointment scheduling service: the first straight-through appointment service for a 
bank in The Netherlands. 
Customers, prospects and employees can schedule an appointment online with a financial  advisor with the right skills to 
handle their specific need (mortgage, financial advice). 
The system substantially improves the conversion rate and thereby the sales funnel.
This is a key IT project within assisted channels (financial advisory at ING offices) which will form the technical backbone 
in future contact between ING and its clients or prospects.


# About the system

The system integrates with the Exchange calendars of 1300 advisors and meeting rooms in 250 branch offices and other 
appointment scheduling systems in the bank to do near real-time checks for availability to optimize the customer experience.
The backend uses Scala, Cassandra and asynchronous programming techniques to create a scalable platform so its use can be 
expanded to other countries.

ING firmly believes in the promise of standardized component driven development and a universal design language for 
front-end development. ING has adopted web components (Polymer) and Material Design to make the ING front-end stack 
ready for years to come. The appointment scheduling service is part of the world-wide ING transition from AngularJS to 
Polymer.

Codestar supplies the full-stack expertise and a broad knowledge of platforms to support the maintenance of the appointment 
scheduling system and the migration to the new platform.
